👋 Hi, I’m @gauravchile

👀 I’m interested in Linux system administration, server management, and automation.

🌱 I’m currently expanding my expertise in user and permission management, system hardening, monitoring, and scripting using tools like Bash, Python, and Ansible.

💼 My hands-on experience includes:

User & Permission Management: Created multi-user setups with Admin/Staff/Guest roles, configured directory permissions, and automated access control using scripts.

System Hardening: Configured secure SSH access, firewalls, file integrity monitoring, and regular system updates for Linux servers.

Automation & Scripting: Developed Bash scripts for system maintenance, backups, and permission testing.

💻 I’ve also completed projects and labs focused on Linux administration, file system management, and process monitoring.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to Linux server setups, automation scripts, and system security configurations.
