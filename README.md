👋 Hi, I’m @gauravchile

👀 I’m interested in cybersecurity defense mechanisms, particularly network defense, threat detection, and incident response

🌱 I’m currently expanding my expertise in forensic analysis, system hardening, and security monitoring using tools like Splunk, Elastic Stack (ELK), Wireshark, and Snort

💼 My hands-on experience includes:
Network Intrusion Detection & Vulnerability Scanning: Implemented a security setup using Snort for real-time monitoring and Nmap for vulnerability assessments
System Hardening: Secured a CentOS server by configuring SSH hardening, firewall rules, and enforcing SELinux. Also integrated AIDE for file integrity monitoring and Auditd for detailed logging
Incident Response: Acted as an analyst during simulations, identifying, reporting, and mitigating phishing attempts and malware threats

💻 I’ve also completed various challenges, including Capture the Flag (CTF) and TryHackMe labs, focused on ethical hacking, network security, and system exploitation.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to SOC simulations, incident response workflows, and cybersecurity tool integration
